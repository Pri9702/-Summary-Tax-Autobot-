## How is it used?

How It’s Used

Tax AI Autobot is designed to be your digital assistant for managing SARS-related communication. It helps you save time, reduce errors, and maintain compliance — all from one interface.
2. Choose a Task

For example, you select:
“Request Client Documents for VAT Registration.”

The bot then:

Checks which client files are already on record.

Asks you for missing info (like company name, trading number, etc.).

Generates a professional email or letter requesting the right documents from your client.

✅ Example output:

“Dear [Client Name],
Kindly provide the following documents to proceed with your VAT Registration...”

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```
# Example: Request client documents for VAT registration
from tax_autobot import SARSBot

bot = SARSBot()
bot.request_documents(client="ABC Traders", purpose="VAT Registration")
bot.send_to_sars()
